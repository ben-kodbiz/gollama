# Spelling and localisation

# Package and Library Versions

# General Coding Rules

- Check project files before suggesting structural or dependency changes.
- Don't complete the analysis prematurely, if you think you've completed the task but have no way of verifying it, you should ask the user to verify your changes.
- If you're having trouble using a library correctly you should look up it's documentation using the tools available to you.
- If you're modifying software that has an existing test suite, you should run the tests and ensure they pass when you think you've completed the task.
